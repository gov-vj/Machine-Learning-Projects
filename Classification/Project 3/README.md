# Logistic Regression with L2 regularization

Libraries used: numpy, pandas, matplotlib.pyplot, sklearn.linear_model, sklearn.feature_extraction.text, string, json, math

Tools used: Jupyter Notebook

It is a logistic regression with L2 regularization to classify positive reviews from negative reviews.

I have plotted the graph of coefficient values vs L2 penalty and observed that as we increase the penalty coefficients merge to zero.
