It is a logistic regression to classify positive reviews from negative reviews.

Libaries used: numpy, pandas, matplotlib.pyplot, sklearn.linear_model, sklearn.feature_extraction.text, string, json, math

Tools used: Jupyter Notebook

I have trained 2 different models.

* model 1: The feature vector is a word vector of all possible word in the reviews of training data.
* model 2: In this word vector is of selected words such as love, great, waste, return etc.

I have compared the accuracy of both models with the accuracy of the majority class prediction model.
