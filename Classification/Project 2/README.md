# Implementing  logistic regression from scratch

Libaries used: pandas, numpy, json, string, math

Tools used: Jupyter Notebook(python 3.x)

I have implemented logistic regression from scratch which not only classify the reviews but also give the probability.

x is a vector of 193 unique words such as great, love, etc. and an intercept. 

y is the probability of the review being positive.

Result: Accuracy of the model is 75.186%.
