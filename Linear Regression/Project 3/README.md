# Polynomial Regression

Libaries used: pandas, numpy, sklearn, matplotlib

Tools used: Jupyter Notebook (python 3.x)

In this, I trained 16 different models where an ith model has degree i and tune the degree parameter using cross validation data.

x= powers of sqft_living

y= price

Point to remember: As we add more power, the complexity of model increases and the model becomes overfit.

Result: Polynomial of degree 6 is best fit.
