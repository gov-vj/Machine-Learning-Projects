# Implementing-closed-form-solution-for-simple-regression

It is a simple linear regression where I have implemented the closed form solution and train 2 different models.

Libaries used: numpy, pandas, matplotlib

Tools used: Jupyter Notebook

Model 1: y= House Price, x= sqft_living (House size in sq. ft.)

Model 2: y= House Price, x= number of bedrooms

Result: Model 1 is more accurate than model 2.
