# Feature selection using LASSO

Libaries used: numpy, pandas, matplotlib, scikit

Tools used: Jupyter Notebook

In this, I used LASSO and vary L1 penalty to study the effect of it on the feature selection in our house prediction model.


##### In 2nd part of the project I have implemented LASSO from scratch using coordinate descent.
